	<h2><b>Directions</b></h2>
	<h4>Scotch Eggs</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Hard boil all but one of the eggs. Cool and peel them.</li>
		<li>If baking the Scotch Eggs then preheat an oven to 400ËšF.</li>
		<li>Prepare Mustard Sauce now if not already prepared, continue while sauce is chilled.</li>
		<li>If the sausage is in a casing cut open casing and squeeze out the meat into a mixing bowl.</li>
		<li>If using the black pudding then mix in the desired amount into the sausage meat.</li>
		<li>Mix in a large pinch of salt and pepper along with a clove of garlic into the meat.</li>

		<li>Put Breadcrumbs into remaining tray</li>
		<li>Cover a sausage coated egg in seasoned flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs. Repeat with others.</li>
		<li>If baking, place Scotch Eggs onto baking sheet and into oven for approximately 35 minutes or until sausage is no longer pink near egg.</li>
		<li>If frying, put enough oil into a frying pan to cover bottom, about 2 TBS (Enough for frying).</li>
		<li>Fry the Scotch Eggs until there is no pink meat near the egg, a few minutes per side.</li>
